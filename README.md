## :scroll: Description
Meet your future four paws friend in this application. Discover a kitten who will give you love and happiness if you open the door of your house to him.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Project developed to update my knowledge on Compose. I tested this new framework in previous releases and didn't have the time to check evolution.
This challenge brings back the motivation to look at this new big thing in the Android ecosystem.

Moreover, I enjoyed the subject because I could use pictures of my own kittens and the ones of my friends! Every one participated in this project!
